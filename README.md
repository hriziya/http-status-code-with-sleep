just modify the status code and sleep duration for your testing. Deployed on free version, so it could take a minute for first spin up.

# Node.js template

This is a Node.js project with an HTTP server.

Add your [configuration](https://codesandbox.io/docs/projects/learn/setting-up/tasks) to optimize it for [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io).

## How does this work?

We run `yarn start` to start an HTTP server that runs on http://localhost:8080. You can open new or existing devtools with the + button next to the devtool tabs.
